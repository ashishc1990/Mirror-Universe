Possible Strategies

- Explore the Board.


If the exploration is complete OR the exit is spotted by both
- find the shortest path for both both.
- Take the steps that takes you closer
  to the exit, for both the players.



Maps
- 1 big 
  no obstacles (Blank Map)
  Exits on different corners
  
	We want to see if they can possibly exit on the same move OR
	will it take a minimum of D turns.

-1 Big 
   1 long wall in the middle of the map, having size d-2.

-1 small board
   Like the Checkers Board - allow only Diagonal movements.


------------------------INTERESTING MAP--------------------------------
	    1 large map, that limits Diagonal movement
	    1 small map that only allows orthogonal movement - 
	      making the exit just a few steps away
	    
So in this case, we can't make diagonal movements, to reduce the skew.

-------------------------Strategies-------------------------------------

1. Explore.
   -Backtrack when there is nothing else to see.
   -Take the spiral path.
   
2.Approach Exit.
  -Do this once both of them have seen their exit.

-------------------------------CLASS Structure----------------------------

Strategy.java - holds diff methods -Explore, Reduce Skew, Approach Exit

Player.java - holding 2 static arrays of size 200x200 - 
	      initialize 2 different arrays.
	      4 - havent seen it yet 
	      3	- Your Current Position
	      2	- Exit
	      1	- Obstacle/Wall
